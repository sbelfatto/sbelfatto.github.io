      <p>Take some time to check out what I have been working on lately!</p>
	  <h2>Response to big ball of mud reading</h2>
	  <p>I felt most of this article was fluff and not very useful to me. I appreciate his large vocaubulary but found the writing not concise. Weeding through his wordy run on sentences was rather frustrating.
	  What I took away from this article was that programmers generally create “big balls of mud” because they can push it out and get user feedback. With any software user feedback is important but he also touched on three 
	  different ways to deal with it, “Foote and Yoder propose three approaches: maintain and evolve (“Keep it Working”); throw it out and start over; or “surrender to entropy and wallow in the mire.” In conclusion, 
	  I found the article incredibly wordy and of not much value other than the hyperlinks provided in the article. Reading wordy articles like this I lose interest quickly.</p>
