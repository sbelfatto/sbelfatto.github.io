<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<h3>Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.</h3>
<p>
OR gate: output 1 if any inputs are 1, otherwise 0.
AND gate: output 1 if all inputs are 1, otherwise 0.
NOR gate: output 1 if no inputs are 1, otherwise 0.
NAND gate: output 1 unless all inputs are 1.</p>
<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<h3>A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?</h3>
<p>Two components: an AND gate and an XOR gate.
Two inputs (one for each bit) and two outputs, for the sum and the carry.</p>

<h3>A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?</h3>
<p>A full addrer is built from three components: two half adders and an OR gate.
Three inputs and two outputs for sum and carry</p>

<h3>How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?</h3>
<p>Seventeen inputs for each bit of the two 8-bit inputs.Because we are using full adders we have an extra as well. Nine outputs for each bit of the output.</p>


<h3>How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?</h3>
<p>144 transistors are needed.</p>


<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<h3>Define byte.</h3>
<p>A byte is a group of binary digits or bits generally 8 operated on as a unit.</p>

<h3>What is the range of an unsigned byte? A signed two's complement byte?</h3>
<p>the range of an unsigned byte is 0 to 255. The rainge of a signed byte is -128 to 127.</p>

<h3>What does the X in the following binary number represent 1010X10101?</h3>
The X in the binary number above represents 32 (2^6). 

<h3>What is the base 16 number system called?</h3>
<p>The base 16 number system is called The hexadecimal numeral system.</p>

<h3>Why is base 16 a good choice for representing binary numbers?</h3>
<p>base 16 is a good choice for representing binary numbers because it their format is much more compact and easier to understand rather than a long string of binary 0's and 1's</p>

<h3>What base 16 number is 101011000011? What is an easy way to determine this without using a calculator?</h3>
Each group of 4 bits corresponds to a hex digit. In 1010 1100 0011, the bits correspond to 8 + 2, 8 + 4, and 1 + 2, i.e. 10, 12, and 3. Written in hex, those values are a, c and 3. So the hex representation is ac3.

<h3>What does the X represent in the following base 16 number D4AXF0?</h3>
<p>The X in the base number above represents 256 (16^2).</p>


<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<h3>What do the prefix names kilo, mega, giga, tera, and peta represent in bytes and what were the Greek origins of the words?</h3>
<p>The prefix names represent: 10001, 10002, 10003, 10004, and 10005 in bytes.</p>
<p>Kilo- from the Greek word for "thousand". Mega- means "great", giga-  means "giant", and tera-  means "monster" and peta comes from the Greek πέντε for "five".</p>

<h2>At the end of Chapter 16 the author reminds the reader about something that is "very important," what is this?</h2>
<p>RAM requires a constant flow of electricity. When it loses power, all the information it contains is lost too.</p>
