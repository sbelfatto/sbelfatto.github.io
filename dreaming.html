      <h2>Chapter 0</h2>
	  <h3>Who wrote “software is hard?” Who is that guy?</h3>
	  <p>Donald Knuth, author of The Art of Computer Programming</p>
<h3>Programmers start counting at what number?</h3>
<P> 0 Scott Rosenburg named the first chapter chapter 0 to ,"Tip my hat to one small difference between computer programmers and the rest of us."</p>
<h3>What was the original sense of a “hacker?”</h3>
<p>The original sense of a "hacker" was, "obsessive programming tinkerer."</h3>
<h3>According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled?</h3>
<p>two out of three projects</p>
<h3>Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?”</h3>
<p>Frederick P. Brooks Jr.</p>


<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

	<h3>What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Jed Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold.</h3>
	<p> Michael Toy is the manager, John Anderson is a "systems architect" but also looked to as the lead coder. Jed Burgess is a programmer. Mitchell Kapor is the founder and funder of the OSAF and "Chandler is his baby."</b>
	 Lou Montulli is a programmer</p>
	<h3>What is “Bugzilla?”</h3>
	<p>"Bugzilla" is a program that hold the list of all the bugs that have to do with this product.</p>
	<h3>What is OSAF?</h3>
	<p>Open Source Applications Foundation.</p>
	<h3>What is the projects name?</h3>
	<p>Chandler</p>
	<h3>What will the software do?</h3>
	<p>it is supposed to be a powerful "personal information manager"</p>
	<h3>What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs?</h3>
	<p>scary</p>
	<h3>What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?</h3>
	<p>He was scared about not knowing how long it would take to fix the bug.</p>
	<h3>What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”</h3>
	<p>"Snakes" are "important problems that we don't have a consensus on how to attack."</p>
	<h3>In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?</h3>
	<p>it is a euphemism for lateness</P>
	<h3>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?</h3>
	<p>the creation of the operating system for the IBM System/360 </P>
	<h3>What is Brooks's Law?</h3>
	<p>"Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."</p>
	<h3>Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?</h3>
	<p>"all software projects require only one-sixth of their time for the writing of code."</p>
	<h3>Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?</h3>
	<p>"When a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication amont them" He felt that there are too many changing variables to make "man-month" applicable.</p>
	<h3>What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?</h3>
	<p>The program you install on your computer is "machine executable" it is dense and unreadable by most people. Source code is human written and readable.</p>
	<h3>What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?</h3>
	<p>That open source software open to anyone to "tinker" with will at some point improve in ways that "closed" software cannot.</p>
	<h3>What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?</h3>
	<p>a good programmer knows what to write. A great programmer knows what to rewrite and how to adapt something already written.</p>
	<h3>Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.</h3>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?</h3>
	<h3>What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?</h3>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

	<h3>Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain.</h3>
	<p> Torvalds reffers to traditional software as witchcraft and because of this it will eventually fail. He believes that because it is kept secret
	There will eventually be to big of a problem for one company or one person to solve. "You have to have everybody share in knowledge."</p>
	<h3>People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term</h3>
	<p>This term was borrowed from the concept of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps "to describe the paradox of getting a computer up and 
	running when you first turn a computer on."</p>
	<h3>Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?</h3>
	<p>The GUI was developed at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centrer.</p>
	<h3>List three software project “train wrecks.”</h3>
	<p>The FBI Computer Overhaul, this project was a trainwreck due to major scope creep.<br />
	   The IRS has tried to "modernize its computer systems," They have failed three times and spent over 2 billion dollars. Still using a mainfraim system from the 60's<br />
	   The misile defense system has been going on for 3 decades and still not finished.</p>
	   
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
	
	<h3>When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”</h3>
	<p>Brooks believes you will not get it right the first time so it is best to plan to throw one away. I could not agree more. I never get a program right the first time. Trial and error.
	I also feel like you learn more when you break something.</p>
	<h3>What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?</h3>
	<p>The word core is used because the commercial computers of the 50's and 60's memory banks were built out of wound wire coils known as ferrite cores. 
	A core dump is a report of the contents of acomputers memory at the moment of failure. Giving a lot of clues for bug hunters. Core dumps usually happen 
	when there is an "irreconciliable conflict or unexpected error."</p>
	<h3>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?</h3>
	<p>Assembly Language</p>
	<h3>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?</h3>
	<p>According to the book, "a kind of uberprogram running on the computer called a complier would translate those commants into object code in the machine's own language."</p>
	
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
	
	<h3>What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?</h3>
	<p>"Front end talks to people: the back end talks to bits." The front end is where user experience lives and things being pretty and intuitive are important. Back end is where the computing really happens in my eyes
	Back end is where user input goes to be stored and used for the computer to run its processes and make sense of everything.</p>
	<h3>What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?</h3>
	<h3>Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.</h3>
	
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

	<h3>What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome?</h3>
	<p>the "quality triangle," Basically making any software project fast, cheap and good. generally speaking you cannot achieve all three. </p>
	<h3> What is the more recent definition of “geek?”</h3>
	<p>"Geek: A person who has chosen concentration rather than conformity; one who pursues skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not mainstrean social acceptance."</p>
	<h3>What does “refactoring” mean to programmers?</h3>
	<p> refactoring is rewriting a piece of code to make it shorter cleaner and easier to read while still functioning as it should</p>
	<h3>What is “yak-shaving?”</h3>
	<p>Eric Raymond defines it as, "seemingly pointlessactivity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problems which several levels of recusion later, solves the real problem
	you're working on." I think of it as tooling. you have a task that has a set of sub tasks and you create a tool that makes those subtasks faster or easier, thus making the task faster.</p>
	
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

	<h3>What is term “edge cases” referring to in software development?</h3>
	<p>Edge cases are obscure unlikely choices that any software allows. This is when a programmer thinks of every possible scenario you can get into using this software.</p>
	<h3>Summarize briefly Linus Torvalds advice about “large projects” give in 2004</h3>
	<p>He said to not start them. Torvalds believes in working on small trivial projects focusing on the details and not expecting anything to get done fast. He says if you start a project 
	that you plan on being large you most likely will fail. he says to never ever dream of the big picture.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
	<h3>Briefly describe Hungarian notation</h3>
